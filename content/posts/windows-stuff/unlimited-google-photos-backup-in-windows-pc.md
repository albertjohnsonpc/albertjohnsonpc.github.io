### Install WSA ( Windows Subsystem For Android )

> We need to install a modified version of windows subsystem for android in which [root access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_(Android)) is enabled by default.

* Install Windows Subsystem For Android mod from [MustardChef](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds) on github.

* Follow the instructions from the github repo.

> Tip üí°: Download a build with `magisk` enabled an not `kernelsu`. We need magisk for LSposed and Pixelify-Google-Photos

> ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è "Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Subsystem for Android‚Ñ¢Ô∏è (WSA). As a result, the Amazon Appstore on Windows and all applications and games dependent on WSA will no longer be supported beginning March 5, 2025." ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

> I installed and tested some versions of WSA and Version [`2306.40000.4.0`](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/releases/tag/Windows_11_2306.40000.4.0) worked best and without any issues. But feel free to experiment with newer versions.


### Setup LSposed and Pixelify-Google-Photos


* After successfully installing WSA, open the additional settings in the app, and then turn on the `Share user folders` under the Experimental features tab and set the folder you want to share with WSA.

* After that `turn off` the subsystem by coming to the system tab and clicking the turn off button.

* Close the app and reopen it.

* Download and keep [LSposed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) and [Pixelify-Google-Photos](https://github.com/BaltiApps/Pixelify-Google-Photos) in your WSA share folder that we setup earlier.

* Open the files app.

> Make sure that [magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) is installed. Otherwise install by [downloading](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases) the apk.

* Then open the magisk app and head over to the settings and turn on `Zygisk`.

> You can download [LSposed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lsposed.manager&pcampaignid=web_share) app from the play store to manage the LSposed modules.

* Install the Pixelify-Google-Photos apk from files app.

{{< figure src="/windows-stuff/unlimited-google-photos-backup-in-windows-pc/install-pixelify.png" alt="Example Image" width="700" align="center" >}}

* Close the manager app. (Might need to restart WSA)

* Install Google Photos app from the play store.

* Open the Pixelify GPhotos app.
* Change the `Device to Spoof` to Pixel XL (for best results)
* Click the `Force Stop Google Photos` Button.

* After that open the Photos app.
* Head over to the settings and check the account storage section.
* If you see `This Pixel can backup unlimited photos and videos at no charge`, congratulations !!! üéâüéâü•≥ We made it happen ü•π.
* If not, try again üòÅ. I know you can do this üí™.
